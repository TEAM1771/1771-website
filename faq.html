<p class="title">Frequently Asked Questions<br></p>

<p class="bold">What do you do?</p>
<p>
We participate in FRC(F.I.R.S.T. Robotics Competition). F.I.R.S.T. ("For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology") is an international robotics organization dedicated to introducing students to the practical side of STEM fields. Every year, we compete in a F.I.R.S.T. designed robotics competition in which we have a six week build season to design, build, and program a robot, typically around 120 lbs, to participate in the game with.
</p>
<br>
<p class="bold">Where and when does Team 1771 meet?</p>
<p>
First semester, we typically meet every Wednesday in Room 308 at North Gwinnett High School. Second semester is when our build season starts, so then we typically meet 3-4 days a week.
</p>
<br>
<p class="bold">Are all meetings mandatory?</p>
<p>
We understand that many of our members are involved in other activities, so none of our meetings are mandatory, excepting certain meetings second semester to prepare you for our 2-3 day competitions. However, you should typically come to every Wednesday meeting first semester and at least 2 meetings a week second semester to be knowledgable enough to satisfyingly participate in our build season.
This club is what you make of it- the more involved you are, the more you will learn!
</p>
<br>
<p class="bold">Do I need experience to join Team 1771?</p>
<p>
No! Our team's mission is to teach students like you mechanical design, proper tool use, and programming. Prior experience gives you a head start, but it is never too late to start learning.
</p>
<br>
<p class="bold">Do I have to go to North Gwinnett High School to be a part of Team 1771?</p>
<p>
No, although most of our members are students at North Gwinnett High School. To ask about your specific situation, please email us at ngrobo1771@gmail.com
