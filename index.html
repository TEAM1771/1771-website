                If you choose to sponsor us, not only are you helping your local community and the next generation of American engineers, you also will receive tangible benefits. As a veteran team, we will publicize your company at all of our competitions.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                ​Because we are a non-profit organization, we have a 501(c)(3) status, meaning that any donations are tax-exempt. In-kind donations are also appreciated, and will be properly recognized. Every donation helps, and no donation is too small!
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Our team cannot survive without the help of its sponsors. Registration for our first two competitions is $5,000. The Peachtree Championship has an additional attendance cost of $4,000, and the Worlds Championship fee is $5,000. We also have to purchase materials to build our robot, arrange lodging during competitions, and maintain our tools. Our target budget typically is around $20,000 overall.
